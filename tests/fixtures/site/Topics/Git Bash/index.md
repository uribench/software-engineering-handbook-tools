# Git Bash

If you already have [Git][1] installed on your Windows host system, you can use 'Git Bash' command window
that is bundled with the installation of Git, instead of using the Windows command window.

The 'Git Bash' command window not only feels better, but allows executing git commands.

'Git Bash' sits on top of [MingW64][2]. MinGW (Minimalist GNU for Windows) is a distribution that 
contains a subset of the tools used for Linux/Unix environment that have been ported to Windows. It 
includes compilers, a shell, and common command line tools.

'Git Bash' can be configured using ['.bashrc', '.bash_profile', '.profile'][3], but the default 
settings are good enough for a start.
